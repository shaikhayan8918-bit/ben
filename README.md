                <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-10">Does This Sound Familiar?</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">You have a genuine gift. A deep-seated need to help people heal and grow.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">When you're with a client, you're in your element. You create real change. You see the breakthroughs happen.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">But when the session ends... the anxiety creeps in.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Where is the next client coming from?</p>
                <p class="mb-4">You've done what they tell you to do. You got the certifications. Maybe you even spent thousands on a fancy business course that gave you a bunch of theory but no actual clients.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">You post on social media, trying to sound like an expert... but you feel like an imposter because your bank account doesn't reflect the value you provide.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">You're stuck in the feast-or-famine cycle. One month you land a couple of clients and feel a rush of hope. The next... it's quiet. And the worry about paying bills starts eating you alive.</p>
                <p class="font-bold text-xl my-8 text-center italic text-red-700">You're starting to wonder if this dream of a flexible, impactful, and abundant coaching business is even possible for you.</p>
                <p>What happens if this continues? Another year of inconsistent income? Another year of self-doubt? Having to explain to your family why your "business" isn't really a business yet?</p>
                <p class="mt-4">The cost of doing nothing isn't just financial. It's the slow erosion of your confidence and the crushing weight of your unfulfilled potential.</p>
                <p class="mt-6 font-semibold">There has to be a better way. A proven path.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">1. "Get another coaching certification, and the clients will come."</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">2. "Just learn these marketing funnels, and you'll get rich."</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Both are fundamentally broken approaches for coaches and healers.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Coaching programs teach you how to coach. They don't teach you how to get clients, how to structure high-value packages, or how to run a profitable business.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">Business programs, on the other hand, often ignore the most important part of the equation: <span class="font-bold">YOU.</span></p>
                    <p class="mb-4">They don't address the mindset blocks, the past trauma, or the imposter syndrome that keeps you from charging what you're worth and confidently serving your clients at the highest level.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">This is the giant gap in the industry.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold">The breakthrough came when we realized you don't need *another* skill or *another* marketing tactic.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">You need a single, <span class="font-bold">integrated system</span> that combines deep therapeutic work on yourself with proven, step-by-step business frameworks. A system that heals your own blocks so you can become a living example of what's possible... while simultaneously giving you the exact client attraction and enrollment process to build a 6-figure practice.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-10">Your Questions, Answered.</h2>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">That's a completely fair concern. But let's reframe it. How many more months of inconsistent income can you afford? The real cost is staying stuck. How many $3,000 clients would you need to enroll to see a return on this investment? For most, it's just one or two. We provide the entire system to get those clients, and many more, consistently.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">"How do I know this isn’t another certification that won’t help me get clients?"</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Because this is NOT a certification program. It's a business development program that INCLUDES certifications. The skills are just one piece. The core focus is on the business frameworks, client attraction, and sales processes that turn your skills into a reliable, 6-figure income. Plus, our lifetime support model means we are vested in your success long-term, not just for the length of a course.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">"I’m not tech-savvy; will I actually be able to implement?"</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">This isn't a tech program. Our systems are built on simple, human connection and conversation. If you can send an email and have a conversation, you have all the tech skills you need. We focus on frameworks, not complicated funnels or software.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">This program was designed FOR busy professionals. It's a shortcut. The alternative is spending years and wasting thousands of dollars trying to piece this all together yourself through trial-and-error. This system gives you the most direct path, saving you countless hours of frustration so you can build your business and get your time back faster.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">While we have a 12-18 month roadmap to a 6-figure run rate, many of our students sign their first high-paying clients during the training itself. The moment you start implementing the client attraction frameworks, you can start seeing results.</p>
